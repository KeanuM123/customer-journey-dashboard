#  BSG Customer Journey Dashboard

The **BSG Customer Journey Dashboard** is a dynamic, interactive web application built using **Streamlit** that provides real-time insights into customer behavior and satisfaction across key stages of their journey. The goal is to empower data-driven decision-making by visualizing how different customer segments experience the journey, identify areas of concern (e.g., low satisfaction), and explore individual user paths in a clean, easy-to-navigate interface.
